# Programming-an-Autonomous-Driving-Car

This repository consists of the codes used to programme an autonomous driving car on a Raspberry Pi for a Machine Learning assessment. It also includes the report and the presentation as PDF files with examples of the datasets used.


We have employed several techniques such as end-to-end deep learning, object classifi- cation, and transfer learning in order to predict for steering angles and speed, based on images of a basic track. The system learns to drive along the track following the lane markings and stop at obstacles on the road. It learns to stop and go at traffic lights and turn left or right according to the signals on the road.
